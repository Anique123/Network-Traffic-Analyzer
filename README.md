# Packet Classifier using Machine Learning

This is a Python script that captures network traffic and classifies packets based on their port numbers using machine learning. The capture will be used in a SIEM tool to analyze the traffic captured. The script uses the Scapy library for packet capture and feature extraction, and the Scikit-learn library for machine learning.
